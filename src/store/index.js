// how to split the reducers?
// use the combineReducers function and assign a key of your store to one single reducer

// why do we want to split our reducers?
// if our app grows, many actions & cases will be required. If you put everything in a single reducer,
// things will become messy pretty quickly, so let's divide our store into chunks (sub-objects)
// and assign a single little reducer to each one of them.
// improving:
// - readibility
// - maintainability
// our reducers will also be easier to write, because they just need to return a portion of the state!
// remember also that every mapStateToProps in all of your component will STILL RECEIVE the big object
// as a parameter
// and also remember that every time you dispatch an action, EVERY reducer will be triggered,
// so you can even have multiple cases managing the same action in different reducers
